# Space Dash!
Hello World, welcome to Space Dash.

## Inspiration
* Our vision for the project focused around a user's experience entirely.
> This project was made in scope of three key factors: Education, Ease of Access, and Fun. With these in mind, we created an _**on the go**_ website to give quick access to some of the most up-to-date information from [**Nasa's Open API**](https://api.nasa.gov/) collection. 

## What it Does & How it Works
 Our website fetches and displays information from **3** different [**APIs**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API) including: [**APOD**](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html), [Asteroids - **NeoWs**](https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb_query.cgi), and [**InSight**: Mars Weather](https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/weather/). The focus for displaying results was based around simple user interface, ranging from *document.ready* functions already displaying *APOD* data, to data being requested with the click of a button, creating an easy-to-use environment for anyone. The site also uses custom [**HTML**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) and [**CSS**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CSS) to create an atmosphere for geeks, space-lovers, or any human to enjoy ( Space Aliens too! ). Nevertheless, the muscle of the site is  [**JavaScript**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript), pulling all styling, structure, and vision together to make the website work!

### How We Did It
1.  First was the drawing board. We began by brainstorming sketches, layout, and possible outcomes for the result of the project.

2.  In creating the HTML, the main focus was concrete structure. We wanted to make sure our **CSS** and **JavaScript** were going to forge well. The **HTML** was completed with detailed commenting, corresponding/concise classes and IDs, and easy to read spacing for [**Open Source**](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source). 

3. Next, the **CSS** styling was commenced. The CSS styling was focused completely on representation and how we could blend convenience, education, and fun. With this, the CSS process began as below.
i. Our main CSS FrameWork [**Spectre**](https://picturepan2.github.io/spectre/index.html), Animations, and APIs chosen. Also, Blending and Layout checked && [**Media Query**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries) Began

ii. Dedicated Styling & Re-Work. _**Space Dash**_ styling is using [**SVG**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG) Practice [_**Here**_](https://jsfiddle.net/0cLrmn4e/)

 iii. After extended testing, complete animations, custom backgrounds, non-copyright images, custom [Keyframe](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@keyframes) animations, and [Parallax Animation](https://dixonandmoe.com/rellax/) were added for enhancement.
